#+begin_abstract
[[http://www.blog.rekahsoft.ca][#! Lambda Slang]] is the personal technical blog of *Collin Doering*, built using software that
[[https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html][respects our freedoms]].
#+end_abstract

* Features

- [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application][Single Page Application (SPA)]]
- Utilizes CSS 3
- Uses HTML5 Application Cache for offline viewing of website

* Tools

The creation of this website was made possible by the following open source tools and
libraries:

- [[http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/][Hakyll]] is used to generate site from static files
- [[http://fvisser.nl/clay/][Clay]] is used for CSS pre-processing
- [[http://www.getskeleton.com/][Skeleton]] is used for CSS boilerplate
- [[http://www.mathjax.org/][MathJax]] is used for rendering mathematics
- [[http://jquery.com][JQuery]] and [[https://github.com/asual/jquery-address][JQuery-address]] are used for various DOM manipulations
- [[http://inkscape.org/][Inkscape]] and the [[http://www.gimp.org/][Gimp]] were used to create various images/artwork
- [[http://www.gnu.org/software/freefont/][Gnu Free Fonts]], specifically *FreeMono* is used as main font
- [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Gnu Emacs]] because there is no place like home; and no greater editor!

* TODO Guix Development Environment
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args:  :session dev
:END:

** Build Site

#+begin_src shell :results drawer :async
  guix shell -CP -E LANG -E GUIX_LOCPATH -m manifest.scm -- bash -c './site clean; ./site build'
#+end_src

** Modify haskell sources

#+begin_src shell
  guix time-machine -C channels.scm -- shell -CNP -E LANG -E GUIX_LOCPATH -Df guix.scm -m manifest.scm
#+end_src

* TODO Building

[[https://guix.gnu.org/][Guix]] is used to manage dependencies for this project. 

A simple wrapper script ~site~ is provided that also takes care of building the static site
and offering access to hakyll commands.

#+begin_src shell
  ./site build
  ./site watch
#+end_src

* Deploying

Terraform is used to deploy this site. Its configuration files are located in ~./infra~. Three
workspaces are currently available, including:

  - default (unused)
  - staging
  - production

For example, this is how to deploy the production version of the site:

#+begin_src shell
  cd infra
  terraform workspace select production
  terraform plan --var-file=production.tfvars --out local.plan
  terraform apply local.plan
#+end_src
