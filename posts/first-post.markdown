Hi all! Thanks for taking the time to visit my new blog. The terms of use of the content and
source code for the blog are on the [homepage](/). This site is still under light construction,
if you notice any issues please take the time to let me know via
[email](mailto:collin.doering@gmail.com).

The purpose of this blog is to allow me to 'put my thoughts to paper' so to speak. I hope you
will find at least some of my exploits entertaining, as I will discuss varying topics of
personal interest including computers, linux, programming, and math, among others. In an upcoming
post i will detail how i built this Hakyll powered blog.  Though as i mentioned earlier there
are still a few little touch ups to be completed before everything is to my satisfaction;
particularily, i haven't got pagination to work yet. Anyways, once i have it working i will
write a post detailing how i setup this blog. For now, that's all; thanks for reading!
